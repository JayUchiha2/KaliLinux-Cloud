# Equipment

# Video Of Proof
[Kali Linux In Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb_-FCwxuIE)
# The Journey
Setting up digital ocean was the easy part because I have the developers pack because I am currently a college student that took care of the funding for the droplet needed to set up the first virtual machine. I chose an ubuntu machine and using the terminal type in the commands needed to start the first ubuntu virtual machine. After that I installed virtual box on the unbuntu machine so now I have a virtual machine in a virtual machine. Pure Evil!
# Problems 
The amount if times I messed up on the coding in the terminal made this project come from a 2 hour project to the whole day because how time consuming terminal is. and at first virtual box did not want to install correctly but we got there in the end.
